// Harness provides a way for database integrators to validate their implementation against the standard set of queries
// used to develop and test the engine itself. See memory_engine_test.go for an example.
// The typical harness lifecycle during test setup looks like this:
// 1) Harness is instantiated, which should create a sql.MutableDatabaseProvider to use for the rest of setup
// 2) Harness.NewDatabase or Harness.NewTable is called to create the database and tables that will be used for the test
// 3) For some tests, harness.Setup() is called instead of Harness.NewDatabase and Harness.NewTable
// 4) Harness.NewEngine() is called to create an engine with the setup data provided prior. It can be called multiple
// times during a single test run, and must return a "fresh" engine instance each time, i.e. an instance that contains
// exactly the test data provided via other setup methods.
