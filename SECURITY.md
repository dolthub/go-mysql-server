# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository receives periodic releases, but is mostly consumed at specific
Git commits. By default, the tip of `main` is the release artifact which is
supported for all security updates. For impactful security fixes, new released
versions will also be created. If you need ongoing security support for an
older version of go-mysql-server, please [contact
DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/contact), the company behind this project.
